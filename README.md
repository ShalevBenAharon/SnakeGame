# SnakeGame

<h2>Overveiw</h2>
<p>
This project is an implementation of a classic Snake Game, created as part of a one-day project for studying Java. 
The game follows the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
</p>

<h2> Description</h2>

Description
Welcome to the Snake Game! 
The goal is to help the snake grow as large as possible without hitting its own body or the boundaries of the game board. 
Test your reflexes and strategic thinking as you maneuver the snake and try to eat as much food as you can.
</p>
<h2> Features:</h2>
<p>
    Intuitive controls: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's movement.
    Growing snake: Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, presenting new challenges and opportunities.
    Avoid collisions: Be careful not to collide with the snake's own body or the edges of the game board.
    High-score tracking: Compete with yourself or friends to achieve the highest score possible.
    Reflex testing: Sharpen your reflexes and improve your hand-eye coordination while playing the game.
</p>
<h2>How to Play:</h2>
<p>
    Launch the game and take control of the snake.
    Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to guide the snake's movement.
    Aim to eat the food on the game board, which will make the snake grow longer.
    Avoid collisions with the snake's body or the board bounds.
    The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the board boundaries.
    Challenge yourself to achieve a higher score with each playthrough.
</p>
